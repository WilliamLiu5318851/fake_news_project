        I have an original news and multiple related news. I want to evaluate how much these news deviate from the original news based on the following criteria:

        1. Sentiment Shift (SS): How does the sentiment of the news compare to the original news? Is the tone more positive, negative, or neutral compared to the original?
        2. Introduction of New Information (NII): Does the news introduce additional information not in the original news, such as political conspiracy or speculation? Evaluate how much of the article is focused on these new details.
        3. Certainty Shift (CS): How does the news language change in terms of certainty? Does it use more ambiguous terms like "possibly" or "allegedly" compared to the original news, or does it present the information with more certainty?
        4. Stylistic Shift (STS): How does the writing style compare to the original? Has the news moved from neutral reporting to a more exaggerated or dramatic tone?
        5. Temporal Shift (TS): Does the news shift focus from the specific event mentioned in the original news to broader or unrelated timeframes, such as mentioning legal battles or long-term political issues?
        6. Perspective Deviation (PD): Does the article introduce subjective opinions or perspectives that deviate from the objective reporting in the original news? For instance, questioning the truth of the event or speculating on hidden motives.

        [NEW CRITERIA ADDED]
        7. Sensationalism Index (SI): Does the news use exaggerated, fear-mongering, or highly provocative language designed to trigger strong emotional reactions or clickbait compared to the factual original?
        8. Source Attribution Alteration (SAA): Has the news removed credible sources present in the original, or invented vague/fake authorities (e.g., changing "Dr. Smith" to "anonymous experts claim")?
        9. Political/Ideological Bias (PIB): Has the originally neutral event been twisted to attack, support, or frame a specific political ideology, party, or social group?

        Task: Please evaluate the following news based on each criterion and provide a score from 0 to 10, where 0 means the article is completely aligned with the original news, and 10 means it has fully deviated.

        Original News: {original_news}
        News articles to Evaluate: {evolved_news}
        
        Please provide the results in the following format: Output ONLY a valid JSON object. Use the exact abbreviations as keys ("SS", "NII", "CS", "STS", "TS", "PD") and numerical values for scores.
